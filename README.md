# fargo
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/hudl-OSS-orange.svg)](http://hudl.github.io/)

Netflix Eureka client in golang. Named for the show Eureka.

```go
c = fargo.NewConn("http://127.0.0.1:8080/eureka/v2")
c.GetApps() // returns a map[String]fargo.Application
```

# Testing

Tests can be executed using docker container. See the below section to build and start 
all the required containers. Once the Eureka containers are running, and fargo image is built then you can run the command as follows:

Run:
```
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/go/src/github.com/hudl/fargo -w /go/src/github.com/hudl/fargo hudloss/fargo:master go test -v ./...
```
Note: If you are running bash for Windows add `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 ` at the beginning.

The tests may need to be run a couple of times to allow changes to propagate
between the two Eureka servers. If the tests are failing, try running them again
approximately 30 seconds later.

If you are adding new packages to godep you may want to update the `hudloss/fargo` image first.

# Known Issues

Until [this PR](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/pull/2742) is in an
official vagrant release, the Fedora 19 opscode box will fail when setting up
private networks in vagrant 1.2.5 and later.

# FAQ

Q: Is this a full client?

A: Not yet. It's very much a work in progress, and it's also being built with
consideration for Go idioms, which means some Java-isms will never be included.

Q: Does it cache?

A: No, it does not support caching records.

Q: Can I integrate this into my Go app and have it manage hearbeats to Eureka?

A: Glad you asked, of course you can. Just grab an application (for this example,
"TESTAPP")

```go
// register a couple instances, and then set up to only heartbeat one of them
e, _ := fargo.NewConnFromConfigFile("/etc/fargo.gcfg")
app, _ := e.GetApp("TESTAPP")
// starts a goroutine that updates the application on poll interval
e.UpdateApp(&app)
for {
    for _, ins := range app.Instances {
        fmt.Printf("%s, ", ins.HostName)
    }
    fmt.Println(len(app.Instances))
    <-time.After(10 * time.Second)
}
// You'll see all the instances at first, and within a minute or two all the
// ones that aren't heartbeating will disappear from the list. Note that after
// calling `UpdateApp` there's no need to manually update
```

# TODO

* Actually do something with AWS availability zone info
* Currently the load balancing is random, and does not give preference to
  servers within a zone.
* Make releases available on [gopkg.in](http://gopkg.in)

# Hacking

## Just Let Me Import Already

`go get github.com/hudl/fargo`

```go

package main

import (
    "github.com/hudl/fargo"
)

func main() {
    e, _ := fargo.NewConnFromConfigFile("/etc/fargo.gcfg")
    e.AppWatchChannel
}

```

## Adding Stuff

`go test` is your friend. I use the excellent [goconvey](http://goconvey.co/)
library in addition to the standard lib's `testing` package. If you add
something, write a test. If something is broken, write a test that reproduces
your issue or post repro steps to the issues on this repository. The tests
require that you have a eureka install and are designed to run against the
included [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) specs.

## Verifying Releases

We're on semver and tag releases accordingly. The releases are signed and can
be verified with `git tag --verify vA.B.C`.

## Using Docker

Fargo is tested against two eureka versions, v1.1.147 and v1.3.1. To support
testing, we provide Docker containers that supply Eureka locally. Here's how to
get started.

1. Clone Fargo
1. If you don't have it, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

```bash
# Defaults to 1.1.147, can be set to 1.3.1
EUREKA_VERSION=1.1.147

cp docker-compose.override.yml.dist docker-compose.override.yml

docker-compose up -d

# Run the tests
```
